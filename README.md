# DS4002-CS3
DS 4002 Case Study 3

The following GitHub repository contains the information necessary to reproduce a project utilizing time-series data focused on air pollutant concentrations. Included is the original and cleaned data (in the Data folder), a Python script that contains a Random Forest regression model to validate and predict future pollutant concentrations (in the Scripts folder), three articles that further explain the importance of air quality and the different types of regression models (in the Supplemental Materials folder), a rubric to guide you in completing the project (CSRubric), and a brief introduction to the project (Hook Document).
Recommended procedure:
1. Read the Hook Document to understand what the case study is asking you to do.
2. Read the supplemental articles to get a better understanding of the motivation and context for the project, as well as the different types of models you may use to complete it.
3. Look at the original data and the cleaned data to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the model to be trained properly.
4. Read through the provided code and do your best to understand how it works.
5. Download the code and original data to the same location on your computer. Run the code.
6. Observe the graphs and table produced by the code, and see if they sufficiently answer the question posed by this case study.
7. Periodically check the provided rubric to ensure that you are on track.
